## 📝 Notes & Guidelines

### Using This Checklist

**For Project Managers:**
- Review this checklist weekly during sprint planning
- Update task status as work progresses
- Use milestones to track overall project health
- Adjust timelines as needed based on team capacity

**For Developers:**
- Reference specific milestone tasks during sprints
- Check off tasks as you complete them
- Add subtasks or notes as needed
- Flag blockers or dependencies

**For Stakeholders:**
- Use milestone acceptance criteria to track progress
- Review completed milestones during monthly check-ins
- Provide feedback on priorities and timeline

### Task Status Conventions
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[>]` - In progress (optional notation)
- `[?]` - Blocked or needs clarification (optional notation)

### Priority Levels
Tasks are organized by milestone, which implies chronological priority. Within each milestone:
- **Critical:** Must complete for milestone acceptance
- **High:** Important but could defer to next sprint if needed
- **Medium:** Nice to have, can defer to later phase
- **Low:** Future enhancement, document for later

### Customization
This checklist is comprehensive but should be adapted to your specific needs:
- Add tasks based on your specific requirements
- Remove tasks that don't apply
- Adjust timeline based on team size and velocity
- Split large tasks into smaller subtasks
- Add technical details as needed

### Dependencies
Many tasks have dependencies on earlier tasks. Pay attention to:
- Backend endpoints must exist before frontend can consume them
- Database schemas must be created before models
- Authentication must work before protected features
- Testing depends on features being complete

### Collaboration
- Use GitHub Issues to track individual tasks
- Link tasks to pull requests
- Add comments for context or decisions
- Update this document as the single source of truth
